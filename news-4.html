			<h2>Coronavirus: Retail workers 'scared' as cases surge</h2>
			<p >Labour activists in the US say big retailers like Amazon and Walmart must do more to protect workers as surging coronavirus cases coincide with the holiday shopping rush.</p>
			<p>They are calling for hazard pay, paid sick leave and better communication about outbreaks, among other things.</p>
			<p>The campaign comes as workers across the US have spoken out about condition and concerns over their health.</p> 
			<p>"Associates like me are scared," said Walmart worker Melissa Love.</p>
            <p>The workers rights campaign launched on Monday was organised by United for Respect, a workers rights non-profit that says it represents more than 16 million people across the US.</p>
